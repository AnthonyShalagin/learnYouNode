/*
Don't expect these three servers to play nicely! They are not going to
  give you complete responses in the order you hope, so you can't naively
  just print the output as you get it because they will be out of order.

  You will need to queue the results and keep track of how many of the URLs
  have returned their entire contents. Only once you have them all, you can
  print the data to the console.

  Counting callbacks is one of the fundamental ways of managing async in
  Node. Rather than doing it yourself, you may find it more convenient to
  rely on a third-party library such as [async](https://npmjs.com/async) or
  [after](https://npmjs.com/after). But for this exercise, try and do it
  without any external helper library.
